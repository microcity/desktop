# 4.3 Shapes and Tables
Users can manipulate **Shapes** and **Tables** with MicroCity Script. For detailed data structure of **Shapes**, you can refer to previous chapter [2.2](2.2_searching_for_countries.md#gis-data-structure) and [3.2](3.2_vector_shapes.md). Because **Shapes** can be treated as **Tables** with extra field with geographic data, some of embeded functions for tabular data manipulation can be used both in **Shapes** and **Tables**. Sample codes for this chapter can be found in the "shapes_samples" folder of the **Project** Tab in ![icon](imgs/icon_script_editor.png)**ScriptEditor**.
## Tabular Data Manipulation
```lua
CreateShapes ("name", "Point|Line|Polygon")
```
Returns a *Shapes* object.
```lua
CreateTable ("Name")
```
Returns a *Table* object.
```lua
GetFieldCount (Shapes|Table)
```
Returns the number of fields in a *Shapes* or *Table*
```lua
GetField (Shapes|Table, iField)
```
Inputs the index (starts from 1) of a field and returns the field name and type ("Int", "Float", "Double" or "String).
```lua
AddField (Shapes|Table, "field1", "Int|Float|Double|String" [, "field2", "Int|Float|Double|String", ...])
```
Adds fields to a *Table or *Shapes* and returns booleans (*true* or *false*) by order.
```lua
DelField (Shapes|Table, iField)
```
Returns *true* if successfully delete a field.
```lua
GetRecCount (Shapes|Table)
```
Returns the total number of records in a *Shapes* or *Table*.
```lua
AddRecord (Shapes|Table)
```
Adds a record to a *Shapes* or *Table* and returns the index.
```lua
GetValue (Shapes|Table, "field_name", index1 [, index2, ...])
```
Retrieve values from a specified field and indexes of a *Shapes* or *Table*. Returns multiple values by the order of indexes. 
```lua
SetValue (Shapes|Table, value, "field_name", index1 [, index2, ...])
```
Sets values for a specified field and indexes of a *Shapes* or *Table*.

## Geographic Data Manipulation
```lua
GetShape (Shapes, index1 [, index2, ...])
```
Returns *Shape* objects from a *Shapes* by the order of indexes.
```lua
AddShape (Shapes, Shape)
```
Adds a *Shape* object to a *Shapes* and returns its index.
```lua
AddShape (Shapes [, x1, y1, x2, y2, ...])
```
Adds a *Shape* object to a *Shapes* which defined as points. Returns the *Shape* object and index.
```lua
DelShape (Shape|Shapes)
```
Deletes a *Shape* or *Shapes* object and returns ture if successful.
```lua
AddPoint (Shape, x, y [, iPart = 1])
```
Adds a point to a *Shape* and returns ture if successful.
```lua
InsPoint (Shape, x, y [, iPoint = 1 [, iPart = 1]])
```
Inserts a point to a *Shape* and returns ture if successful.
```lua
SetPoint (Shape, x, y [, iPoint = 1 [, iPart = 1]])
```
Sets a point coordinates in a *Shape* and returns ture if successful.
```lua
DelPoint (Shape, iPoint [, iPart=1])
```
Deletes a point at position iPoint from a *Shape* and returns ture if successful..
```lua
DelPart (Shape, iPart)
```
Deletes a part from a *Shape* and returns ture if successful.
```lua
GetPartCount (Shape)
```
Returns the number of parts in a *Shape*.
```lua
GetPointCount (Shape [, iPart])
```
Returns the number of points in a *Shape*.
```lua
GetPointXY (Shape [, iPoint [, iPart = 1]])
```
Returns all points' coordinates: x1, y1, x2, y2, ... from a *Shape* or a specified point's coordinate.
```lua
CopyShapeTo (TargetShapes, dx, dy, Shape1 [, Shape2, ...])
```
Copys *Shape* objects to a target *Shapes* with relative translation (dx, dy) and returns new *Shape* objects.
```lua
MoveShapeTo (dx, dy, Shape1 [, Shape2, ...])
```
Translates *Shape* objects to its relative position (dx, dy).
```lua
GetCenterXY (Shapes)
```
Returns the center coordinate (x, y) of a *Shapes*.
```lua
GetCenterXY (Shapes, index1 [, index2, ...])
```
Returns the center coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2, ...) of *Shape* objects specified by indexes in a *Shapes*.
```lua
GetCenterXY (Shape1 [, Shape2, ...])
```
Returns the center coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2, ...) of *Shape* objects. 
```lua
GetDistance (x1, y1, x2, y2 [, x3, y3, ...])
```
Returns the total distance between every two pairs of coordinates (x, y). 
```lua
GetShapeLen (Shape1 [, Shape2, ...])
```
Returns lengths of *Shape* objects.
```lua
GetShapeArea (Shape1 [, Shape2, ...])
```
Returns areas of *Shape* objects.
```lua
GetShapeType (Shape|Shapes)
```
Returns the type ("Point", "Line" or "Polygon") of the a *Shapes* or *Shape* object.
```lua
GetExtent (Shapes)
```
Returns the extent coordinates (Lx, By, Rx, Ty) of a *Shapes*'s extent.
```lua
GetExtent (Shapes, index)
```
Returns the extent coordinates (Lx, By, Rx, Ty) of a *Shape* indexed in a *Shapes*.
```lua
GetExtent (Shape)
```
Returns the extent coordinates (Lx, By, Rx, Ty) of a *Shape*.
```lua
GetIntersection (ShapeA, ShapeB)
```
Returns a *Shape* (*Point*, *Line* or *Polygon*) object of the intersection of two *Shapes*.
```lua
GetValue (Shape, "field_name")
```
Returns the value of specified field of a *Shape*.
```lua
SetValue (Shape, value1, "field_name1" [, value2, "field_name2", ...])
```
Sets values in different fiedds for a *Shape*.
```lua
SetCoorSys ("Earth"|"Non-Earth")
```
Sets coordinate system. If using "Earth", distances, lenths and areas are calculated according to the earth ellipsoid coordinate system. By default the "Non-Earth" is used, which is cartesian coordinate system.
